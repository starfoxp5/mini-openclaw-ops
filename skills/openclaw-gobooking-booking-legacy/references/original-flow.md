# Original Booking Flow Notes

This reference preserves team-authored behavior from:

- `FIONA_預約SOP.md` (v1)
- `skill-draft-badminton.md`

## Preserved SOP Expectations

- Gather complete booking details first.
- Show fixed pre-submit confirmation summary.
- Require explicit user confirmation before external action.
- If failure, provide at least two alternatives.
- Reconfirm for payment and personal-data steps.

## Preserved Draft Expectations

- Target site: `gobooking.tw`
- Typical flow: choose court -> choose date/time -> fill info -> apply discount -> confirm payment -> confirm terms.
- Success criterion: booking success page/dialog appears.
